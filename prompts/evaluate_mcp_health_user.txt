Evaluate MCP server health:

MCP Health Status: %s
Consecutive Failures: %d
Reconnection Attempts: %d
Time Since Last Success: %v
Objective: %s
Task Progress: %s

Execution Context:
%s

What should we do?
- Continue if MCP is healthy or failures are transient?
- Retry connection if server may be temporarily unavailable?
- Stop task if MCP is dead and cannot be recovered?

Consider:
- If failures are recent and few, may be transient
- If many failures after reconnection attempts, server likely dead
- If task is near completion, may be worth waiting
- If task just started, better to stop early
