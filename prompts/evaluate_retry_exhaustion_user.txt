Retry limit exceeded - decide next action:

Subtask: %s
Tool: %s
Error: %s
Retries: %d/%d
Objective: %s

Execution Context:
%s

What should we do?
- Skip this subtask if it's not critical?
- End cycle if this subtask is blocking?
- End task if objective cannot be achieved?
- Recover state if tool state was lost?
- Adjust approach if a different method might work?
- Keep session alive and retry if session is healthy and error might be transient?
