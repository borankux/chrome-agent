Evaluate loop completion:

Objective: %s
Loop Type: %s
Current Progress: %.2f
Target: %.2f
Cycle Number: %d

Execution Context:
%s

Based on this information, determine:
1. Has the objective been achieved? (even if progress < target)
2. Should the loop continue or complete?
3. What is your reasoning?

Consider:
- If objective is achieved early, complete the loop
- If making good progress toward objective, continue
- If stuck or making no progress, consider completing
- Balance between efficiency and thoroughness
