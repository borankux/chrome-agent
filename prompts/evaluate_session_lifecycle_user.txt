Evaluate session lifecycle decision:

Tool Type: %s
Session Health: %s
Error: %s
Consecutive Failures: %d
Total Operations: %d
Success Rate: %.2f%%
Objective: %s

Execution Context:
%s

What should we do with this session?
- Keep alive if session is healthy and error might be transient?
- Recover if session state might be lost but recoverable?
- Recreate if session is completely broken?
- Close only if explicitly necessary?

Remember: Sessions are valuable - preserve them unless there's a strong reason to close.
