Objective: %s

Available Tools:
%s

Analyze this objective and create a structured plan. Break it down into executable tasks where EACH TASK USES EXACTLY ONE TOOL from the available tools list above.

CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Tool State Management:
   - Think about what state each tool creates or needs
   - Group related tools that share state (e.g., browser operations)
   - Order tasks so state-creating tools come before state-using tools

2. Tool Consequences:
   - What happens when you call each tool?
   - What state does it create/modify/query?
   - How do tools depend on each other?

3. Task Ordering:
   - Order tasks logically based on state dependencies
   - Group operations that benefit from shared state
   - Consider tool sequences and their consequences

Remember:
- Each task must specify exactly one tool_name (must match a tool from the list above)
- Each task must include an arguments object (can be empty {} if no arguments needed)
- If the objective requires multiple tool calls, create multiple sequential tasks
- Use the exact tool names as shown in the available tools list
- Think abstractly about tool interactions and state management
