Task: %s

Available Tools:
%s

Analyze this task considering:
1. What tools were called before (if any) and what state they created
2. Whether you should reuse existing tool state or create new state
3. The consequences of calling each tool - what does it do? What state does it create/modify?
4. Tool dependencies - which tools need other tools to run first?
5. State management - how should tool state be maintained across calls?

Think abstractly about tool interactions and their consequences.
